# Async Work (required):
In bellpepper.py, complete the encrypt function in the Caesar Cipher starter code from class. Add code to encrypt lowercase letters as well.

# Homework (choose one):
bell pepper: Write the decryption function of a caesar cipher from the starter code given in class

jalapeno: Write a decryption function for a vigenere cipher with knowing the key

habanero (but do jalapeno first!): The enigma machine is a rotor based encryption machine that simulates 6 vigenere ciphers. Using the resources on Slide 26, recreate the enigma machine by code.

Please place your homework in the cipher folder of your github repo with your selected difficulty level as the title. Ex: If I do the bell pepper assignment, Iâ€™d name it bellpepper.py.
